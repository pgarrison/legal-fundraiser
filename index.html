    <div id=story class=box>
        <div id=above-fold>
        <p><span class="bold">On March 1st of this year I picked up lil A from her home and brought her home with me to keep her safe. Later that same night, lil A&rsquo;s grandma texted me a picture of a fentanyl pill she found on the stairs leading up to lil A&rsquo;s bedroom. I hate to think of what could have happened if I had not picked up lil A that day. </span></p>

            <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Rikki, auntie to lil A, and I need your help in order to give my seven-year old niece safety and stability in my loving care!</p>
            
            <p>I believe that lil A repeatedly witnessed domestic violence and experienced neglect and emotional abuse while in her mother and grandma&rsquo;s care. I am concerned that if lil A does not stay in my care, she will end up in the foster care system. Now, her home life with me is healthy, loving, nurturing, and stable.</p>
            
            <p>To keep lil A safe, I have exhausted my immediate network with legal fees for a minor guardianship case that has cost ~$25k to date. And the trial hasn&rsquo;t even started. I need your help to cover a $25k trial deposit plus ~$10k in anticipated legal fees prior to the trial.</p>
            
            <p>I have dedicated my career to supporting the well-being of young children and families for over 17 years. I&rsquo;ve empowered countless families in their healing journeys, and I&rsquo;ve bravely endeavored on my own healing journey to break the cycles of trauma passed down in my family.</p>
            
            <p>Will you help me break these same traumatic generational cycles for my niece?
            </p>

<h2>Why is it so expensive?</h2>
<p>My lawyer bills up to $435 an hour.</p>
        </div>

        <div id=below-fold>
<ul>
    <li>$42 covers the cost of one email</li>
    <li>$126 covers the cost of a short 18-minute meeting</li>
    <li>$875 covers the cost of preparing documents for one hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>I contacted several lawyers and this was the only one who had capacity or the specialty necessary to take the case. Much of these costs have been from me having to defend myself against outlandish and unfounded claims. Many of you are shocked that I don&rsquo;t get a free or low cost lawyer for this case. Sames babes, sames.</p>

<p>Having worked in this field for some time I am well versed in available resources and scoured resources for low cost or no cost legal representation and found that I did not qualify for those incredibly rare resources. For example, for one resource I missed the salary eligibility cutoff by just $3k.</p>

<p>I am a solo caregiver, now working two jobs (50-60 hrs a week) in order to provide the best life I can for lil A, but I need your help!</p>


<h2>What&rsquo;s up with this court case?</h2>
<p>Having worked with many families involved in the child welfare system, and because I have already had a nephew in the child welfare system, I am keenly aware of the additional trauma that the system can unfortunately cause for kids and families. This is why I petitioned King County Superior Court for emergency guardianship & minor guardianship of lil A in March of this year.</p>

<p>After I became lil A&rsquo;s emergency guardian and obtained her educational and medical records, I learned that she missed 51 days of school at day 98 in the school year, and had not been to a wellness child checkup in over 2 years, despite having repeated emergency room visits, and a hospitalization without follow up care in the last year. She came into my care with a baby tooth that had a missing filling that had fallen out and not been repaired, and shoes that were 2 sizes too small for her. As a mandated reporter in the state of WA I was required to call CPS and inform them of these facts. CPS did an investigation and determined that because lil A was safe and healthy at the present time in my care, they could close the case for the time being.</p>

<p>The ongoing minor guardianship case open with King County Superior court is the result of my petitioning to be lil A&rsquo;s longer term guardian because I have serious concerns about the likelihood that my sister will be well enough to properly care for lil A in the near future. </p>

<p>My sister and I were initially working together as a unified team, but unfortunately she succumbed to the pressure of generational traumas and reverted to repeating old unhealthy cycles. I am hoping for the best for her healing journey, but at a bit more distance now as I had to get a domestic violence protection order to protect myself and lil A from further harm. <span class="bold">If, and only if, my sister is healthy enough to raise lil A again at some point in the future, I would support that transition because I know reunification can be healing for kids and parents. </span> I currently have grave concerns and doubts about that potential in the near future, yet I still wholeheartedly hope my sister finds the healing she needs. </p>

<p>I remain steadfast in protecting lil A from experiencing further trauma, and will do everything I can to promote healing for my precious niece. She is only seven years old and has a chance to have a healthier childhood, unlike myself and so many others in my family. She now goes to school regularly, receives appropriate medical and dental care, and receives specialized mental health services so that she can begin her healing journey early on in life. She now has a loving community and friendships with similar aged peers, a whole social life she never had before.</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>I am in awe of how much love and support lil A and I have received during this difficult time from friends and loved ones. I would not be able to help end the cycles of trauma for lil A if it wasn&rsquo;t for all of you! Extra thank you to everyone who has offered up gifts for donors, shared this fundraiser, and to the two extra special people who made this website. </p>
